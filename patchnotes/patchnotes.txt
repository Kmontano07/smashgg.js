/** Patch Notes **/

/** 1.0.6 :: 03-07-2018 **/
* Added ability for Event to take an ID for an event. 
At the end of the constructor, an optional ID can now be added. 
The rest of the params can even be null.
* Added unit test capability for this addition, but it needs to be
really fleshed out. However it proves the functionality works.

/** 1.0.5 :: 02-01-2018 **/
* Fixed documentation for Set constructor.
* Added section to README about submitting issues or feature requests.

/** 1.0.3 :: 01-31-2018 **/
* Updated documentation with a Table of Contents. Fixed incomplete example in Tournament docs.

/** 1.0.2 :: 01-30-2018 **/
* Refactored errors on SmashGG Object instantiation to emit an 'error' event coupled with an Error object.
* Refactored the simple getters to no longer return a string on null, but instead to Winston log the error.
This should make the getters more dev friendly
* Refactored the simple getters to all reference a similar function since they're all doing the same thing,
unless they return an object property
* Included changes to overall docu. Added a section about integrating a Winston log file.

/** 1.0.1 :: 01-29-2018 **/
* Included the github repository in package.json
